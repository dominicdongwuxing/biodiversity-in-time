Although there have been numerous visualizations on the tree of life and geographical change across millions of years in time, there has been no visualizations reported that combines both, thereby providing the viewers a holistic view of how life and Earth drastically changed across time. \\

This thesis purposes a complete workflow from data processing to data visualization in a web-application. It organizes all 1.3 million animal and plant fossils recorded in the PaleoBiology Database into a tree of life, and tracked fossils locations at various time points with a published tectonic change model. The final result provides a rich and interactive visualization that allows the users to explore the tree of life, Earth geography, and fossil distribution in the world across Phanerozoic Eon.
